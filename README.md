# Experience

## Trivalent, Software Engineer
May 2016 - Present, Annapolis, MD
* Create RESTful web services for Trivalent's Data-at-Rest encryption products. This work entailed designing and implementing the REST interfaces (Java on Tomcat) and back-end daemon processes (Java ) to handle complex, asynchronous processing tasks;
* Construct a CentOS 7 Linux virtual machine (VM) using Vagrant to enable SW developers and QA to integrate with and test against my REST API;
* Create Windows (C#) and Android (Java) applications to debug, test, and demonstrate REST and push notification services provided by the aforementioned VM;
* Develop Android utilities using both Java and NDK/JNI (C/C++) to generate performance metrics on encryption algorithms;
* Secret level security clearance.

## Nteligen, Principal Engineer
Oct 2012 - Apr 2016, Columbia, MD
* Design, develop, and test complex software systems for multiple existing cross domain solutions. My work involved both C/C++ and Java software for protocols such as FSP, HTTP and SNMP on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Solaris operating systems;
* Integrate commercial technologies into existing cross domain solution product. I designed the architecture, oversaw software development and testing (also fixing difficult bugs, assisting developers, writing additional software as needed), documented all phases of work, and supported the end customer installation;
* Adapt existing software libraries/applications for re-use in new product offerings. As above, I participated in all, and supervised many, of the engineering phases;
* Manage internal software development projects. I served as mentor to multiple intern-level engineering students and younger engineers.

## iVeia, Senior Software Engineer
Aug 2008 - Sep 2012, Annapolis, MD
*	Develop Linux kernel device drivers for very small form factor embedded boards;
*	Create command-line tools (Python) and Eclipse plug-ins (Java) to integrate iVeia's software and FPGA development tools. The plug-ins also allow control, configuration and FPGA/SW application deployment to remote target (embedded) devices;
*	Port Android OS to iVeia hardware and implement support for audio, sensor, GPS, and WiFi devices in Android. I also developed multiple Android applications utilizing both Java and NDK/JNI (C/C++) code;
*	Design and develop a Linux package management solution for iVeia's embedded SW/FPGA products simplifying both iVeia's build process and customer installations;
*	Define/oversee development processes and serve as integration/release manager (using both Perforce and Git) to ensure continued product quality. Also mentor younger engineers in development practices.

## Northrop Grumman, Senior Software Engineer
Jul 2006 - Aug 2008, Savage, MD
*	Design, implement, and test multiple Linux server applications for a web-based cross domain solution product used to filter and transfer multiple file formats;
*	Develop a C++ web development framework for generating XML and HTML;
*	Create a server side include replacement syntax and parser to enhance application security;
*	Interface software applications to SQLite databases to enable data persistence;
*	Assist in attaining a CMMI level three certification for software development.

## Spectrum Signal Processing, Senior Software Engineer
Jun 2004 - Jul 2006, Columbia, MD
*	Design, implement, and test custom Windows and Linux PC and VxWorks embedded applications to communicate with third-party hardware/software using proprietary and standard networking protocols;
*	Develop and administer a suite of engineering tools (version control, build tools, bug tracking, and informational web pages) to facilitate the software development lifecycle on multiple projects;
*	Develop C++ software for CORBA on Spectrumâ€™s software defined radio products and PCs to create SCA applications for the JTRS radio program;
*	Integrate multiple third-party hardware/software products with in-house hardware/software components to create communications system solutions.
